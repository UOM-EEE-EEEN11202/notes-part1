Computer software
=================

This is fundamentally a course on computer software, and writing it, and so there is more background to go over on this topic. Important is to have some familiarity with the *command line*. This is a text based interface for giving commands to a computer, and we'll make a lot of use of. 

We don't assume you're coming from a background with programming experience, and so we also go over some of the basic concepts we'll need. Mainly *files* and *folders* which we use to help keep our work organized. We'll also briefly go over the major operating systems and how they differ. The course is in principle cross-platform, it shouldn't matter which operating system you're using.
