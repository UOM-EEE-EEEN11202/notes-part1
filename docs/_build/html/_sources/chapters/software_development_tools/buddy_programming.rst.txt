Buddy programming
=================

A step on from code reviews, where someone else looks at your code after you've written it, is to sit together with another person and write the code together. This means that you can discuss non-trivial aspects as you're writing the code. Any choices are discussed there and then, rather than waiting for a review later. This style of coding requires more resources (i.e. two people), but this may be beneficial overall if the code has fewer issues that need lots of debugging.

.. admonition:: This course

    This is designed as an individual course. We expect most people to discuss their work with their classmates, but there are no *buddy* tasks or similar. Remember, all submitted works must be your own individual work.
