Software development tools
==========================

Writing software is hard. There are lots of ways that code might not do exactly what you want, or might have bugs or other issues. For some people it's a part time activity, but for many people it's a full time job that they're paid for, and that customers pay a lot of money for. It thus shouldn't be surprising that there are lots of tools that have been created to help with writing software. 

Fundamentally a .c file is a text file that you can edit in many different programs. However we strongly recommend using dedicated tools that have been made for writing C code. These contain lots of functions (and we're only really going to scratch the surface) for helping to ensure you write high quality code, and to help you debug your code when things go wrong.

This section provides a brief walk though of some of the most common tools.
