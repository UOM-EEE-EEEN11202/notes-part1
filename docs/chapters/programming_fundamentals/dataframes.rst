Dataframes
==========
Dataframes provide a table-like environment in order to keep our data (which could have lots of different types). It thus provides a spreadsheet-like interface for working with data, which can be very helpful. A dataframe can help us organize our data into a common (table/spreadsheet) format without having to go to the effort of defining our own objects, custom data types and so on. They are very commonly used in *data science* and *data visualization* type applications. 

A picture of a typical dataframe (here made using the `Polars <https://pola.rs/>`_ interface) in Python is shown below.

We won't consider the details of dataframes in more detail here, we will explore them in the labs instead.
