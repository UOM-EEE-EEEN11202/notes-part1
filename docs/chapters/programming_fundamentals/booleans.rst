Booleans
========
Computers operate in binary, where there are only two states. These might be 0/1, or Yes/No, or True/False. These are all different human-interpretable ways of representing fundamentally the same thing, something which can only have two distinct states.

In our programs these are usually represented as :python:`True` and :python:`False`. For example:

.. code-block:: python

   check = True
