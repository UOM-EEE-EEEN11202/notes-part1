Introduction
============

In this Part we're going to look at a number of different ways in which computers operate. It would probably be possible to do an entire course on any one of these topics! Our aim isn't to be the expert in all of them. Rather, the aim is to have enough familiarity in order to be able to progress with our programming.

We won't get very far with our programming without needing to know a little about how computers work *under the hood* in order to know why our code looks the way it does. If we treat the computer as black box, it's very hard to get the most oyt of it. We don't need to know everything about what's inside the box, but knowing a little helps a lot.

Remember that computers are human designed objects - they work the way they do because someone decided to make them work that way. Sometimes these decisions make a lot of sense. Sometimes the decision made sense at the time, possibly 50+ year ago. We might do it differently if we were to do it today, but we have to stick with what's already in place. Sometimes, different people decided different things, and there are different standards or ways of doing things. We need to pick one to actually use, even if other choices are perfectly good and someone else might pick a different one. Before starting our programming we need to know a little about which choices we're making and why. This includes learning about some common software development techniques.

In places some of what we cover will be a bit *approximate*. The descriptions are sufficient and accurate for the depth we need them to be for this course. If you go on to cover some of the topics in more detail, you might find that some of the definitions get refined and a bit tighter compared to what we have here.

In general, we would advise you to read these notes once, at the start of the course. There's quite a few notes and so it will take a good few hours, but it will time well spent. There will likely be lots of items that you don't completely follow or don't make sense. Don't dwell on them for too long. Press on and read through everything before starting the labs. This will give you the best starting point. Then, come back to this section at the end of the course and read through it again. After you've done all of the labs, lots of things which you didn't completely follow at first will likely make much more sense.
