Co-pilot and other AI tools
===========================
We've discussed generative artificial intelligence (AI) and its use in programming `previously <https://uom-eee-eeen11202.github.io/chapters/course_policies/ai_use.html>`_. We won't repeat that information here, but it is important that you read it, as AI tools can't be used in every situation. Moreover, if you don't understand your own code, it's going to be very difficult for you to make it high performance, or to debug difficult cases. 

Nevertheless, it's important to have AI on the list of tools that we have at our disposal to help write correct and high performance code.

.. admonition:: This course

   AI tools are allowed during the course, but won't be available during the final exam. You are advised to make suitable, but informed and responsible, use of them.
